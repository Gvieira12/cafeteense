            Encheção de linguiçaLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
            Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
            a
            galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
            centuries,
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
            in
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
            with
            desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
            when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution
            of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
            Many
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
            and a
            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
            evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
